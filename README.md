# prototype_resource_pack
I'm trying to make a resource pack for Hypixel, and I am also changing some of the vanilla textures. I know I could simplify the process by just extracting the files from Minecraft, but I am very confused. I don't know what to remove or how to add my own subfolders to create the Hypixel resource pack.
